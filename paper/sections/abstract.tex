Tracking performance metrics of applications is indispensable to identify bottlenecks or even where resources should be applied to fix performance issues. Perf is a tool that captures performance metrics from the hardware where the application was executed. However, data captured by Perf can be hard to read and, in some cases, impossible due to the large size of the generated files. Therefore, we propose in this paper a visualization dashboard for data captures using Perf: VisPerf. VisPerf implements a data pipeline from capturing to visualizing data. The dashboard allows the user to compare specific experiments and to see how hardware events varied between these experiments. VisPerf is still in the prototype phase. Therefore, requires some validations, especially with application developers who may take benefits from VisPerf.
