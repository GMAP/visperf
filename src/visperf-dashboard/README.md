## Technologies

We used [D3.js](https://d3js.org) to create the visualizations and [React](https://reactjs.org) to manipulate the interfaces/components.

## Project Documentation

Next, we document the project structure.

-   [src](src): contains the source code;
-   [src/index.js](src/index.js): entry point of the dashboard;
-   [src/components](src/components): commons components;
-   [src/plots](src/plots): plots used in the visualizations;
-   [src/utils](src/utils): helper functions;

## Development Documentation

Here is how you can customize this application and build it.

### Start the visualization dashboard

In the project directory, you can run:

```
yarn start
```

This command runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Build the visualization dashboard

```
yarn build
```

This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
