VisPerf is a [tool-chain](src/tool-chain) and an [interactive visualization dashboard](src/visperf-dashboard) for Perf data. The VisPerf tool-chain profiles the application and pre-processes the data, reducing the storage space required by about 50 times. Moreover, the visualization dashboard allows you to quickly understand the performance of different events and visualize specific threads and functions of a parallel applications.
